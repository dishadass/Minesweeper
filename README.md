1. Introduction

MineSweeper is a single-player puzzle game that originated in the 1960s and gained popularity with the release of Microsoft Windows. The game is set on a grid, and your goal is to uncover all safe squares while avoiding hidden mines. Use logic and deduction to clear the grid without detonating any mines.
2. Objective

The objective of MineSweeper is to uncover all the safe squares on the grid without revealing any mines. You win the game when you've successfully cleared the entire grid of mines.
3. Game Rules

   The game is played on a grid of squares.
    Some squares contain hidden mines, while others are safe.
    Clicking on a safe square reveals the number of adjacent squares containing mines.
    If you click on a square with a mine, you lose the game.
    You can mark squares you suspect as mines with a flag.
    Use logic to determine which squares are safe to click and which ones likely contain mines.
    To win, you must uncover all safe squares without clicking on any mines.

4. Game Controls

MineSweeper is easy to play with a few simple controls:

   Left-Click: To uncover a square and reveal its content.
   Right-Click (or Shift+Left-Click): To place or remove a flag on a square you suspect contains a mine.

    Numbers on uncovered squares indicate the number of mines in adjacent squares.
    Use logic to determine which squares are safe to uncover and which may contain mines.
    Right-click on a square to place or remove a flag if you suspect it's a mine.
    Middle-click (or Left-click on a revealed number square) to uncover adjacent squares when you've correctly flagged the mines around a number square.
    Continue uncovering squares and flagging mines until you've cleared the grid.

10. Tips and Strategies

   Start with the edges and corners of the grid, as they provide more information about adjacent squares.
    Use the numbers as clues. If a square has a "1" next to it, there's one mine nearby. If it has a "2," there are two, and so on.
    Be cautious with your flag placements; make sure you have a good reason to suspect a square contains a mine before flagging it.
    Keep track of the number of mines left to uncover; this can help you make informed decisions.
